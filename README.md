# ttrpg-soundboard 
## Introduction
### What is this project?
This project came about because before this I was using spotify for my background music in my TTRGP campains. Personally, I found it annoying that the songs kept starting over at the beginning while most songs have a 'loop' so the song could theoretically be played indefinitely. This is what is usually used in video games. 
(Also, my spotify wrapped was very influenced by the TTRGPs I played hahaha.)

I have some experience making video games (purely from hobby interests and a college minor in game development) so thought why not make something myself.

### Why Godot?
Why Godot? I still had a Humble bundle of crash courses about Godot that I haved touched. Godot also to my mind has a more friendly UI designer for people who are not artists than, say, Unity or Unreal. Godot also has a simpler inbuild implementation for this purpose end than Unity (I have already started this project once in Unity and stopped doing it because of UI design issues) 

### How frequent will you update?
To be honest, I wouldn't know. I have a full-time job as a mechatronics engineer that requires quite a lot of my energy. The main reason I want to work with the documentation / progression / releases is so I can also put the project down for a while and pick it up later. (This is my most organized hobby project ever.)

I hope to finish this project before 2026 but we will see.
